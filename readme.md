## Q&A

### Is this app an official product?

No, it is not an official product. Cinema City has not officially endorsed or supported the
development of this application. While open to negotiations, the project is an independent effort.

### Does a public API exist?

There is no indication of a public API for Cinema City. The app utilizes proprietary access
credentials, limiting public access. These credentials are not published in the repository but are
bundled with the application.

### Why bother making a clone?

The motivation stems from frustration with Cinema City's current application, perceived as
low-effort. Additionally, the developer believes in elevating Android to a superior platform and is
committed to creating exceptional designs and code for the platform.

### How did you do it?

Dismantling apps is not overly complex. The developer utilized resources bundled with the original
app, copying and pasting them into this project. Overcoming state-of-the-art obfuscation techniques,
the code was then analyzed to understand the inner workings, leading to the creation of this
independent project.

### Can you please add XYZ support to the app? Why not?

Adding specific features, like XYZ, is unlikely unless there's a personal benefit. The substantial
time investment in replicating the entire application requires justification. While the desire is to
create open-source first-class experiences, the financial return is limited. As of now, the project
has already incurred a cost exceeding â‚¬25k, and its value increases with additional features or
fixes.
